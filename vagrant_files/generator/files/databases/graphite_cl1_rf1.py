# db_desc -> more detailed name/description
# jvm_args -> special jvm_args for this db and ycsb
# prerun_once -> list of commands to run local once before ycsb (%%IP%% uses first db vm) (without ycsb, sync or space diff or poweroff commands!)

# basic -> True/False, if True this is a basic database, so no need to ssh for space checking
# sequence -> which vm should be provisioned first? (for all postrun/prerun dicts/lists. First number is considered master db vm, rest are slaves.)
# the following variables are possible in prerun_once, postrun_once, prerun, prerun_master, prerun_slaves, check, check_master, check_slaves, postrun, postrun_master, postrun_slaves, prerun_dict, postrun_dict, check_dict, db_args:
# %%IP%% -> IP of (actual) db vm
# %%IPgen%% -> IP of (actual) generator vm (on which this script runs)
# %%IPn%% -> IP of db vm number n (e.g. %%IP2%%)
# %%IPall%% -> give String with IP of all vms)
# %%SSH%% -> if SSH should be used (set at the beginning)
